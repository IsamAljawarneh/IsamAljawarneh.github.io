An overarching trait of ApproxSSPS is its ability to strike a plausible balance between latency and accuracy targets. We evaluate ApproxSSPS on Apache Spark Structured Streaming with real mobility data. We also compared ApproxSSPS against a state-of-the-art online adaptive processing system.  Our extensive experiments prove that ApproxSSPS can fulfill latency and accuracy targets with varying sets of parameter configurations and load intensities (i.e., transient peaks in data loads versus slow ar-riving streams). Moreover, our results show that ApproxSSPS outperforms the baseline counterpart by significant magnitudes.   In short, ApproxSSPS is a novel spatial data stream processing system that can deliver real accurate results in a timely manner, by dynamically specifying the limits on data samples.  publication: MDPI Sensors 2021 (journal impact factor (indexed in ISI Thomson Reuters): 3.576)\n","date":1637876541,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637876541,"objectID":"a72547a0680a3f1ab2aadb6342e67568","permalink":"https://IsamAljawarneh.github.io/project/spatialapprox/","publishdate":"2021-11-25T21:42:21.558Z","relpermalink":"/project/spatialapprox/","section":"project","summary":"ApproxSSPS is a system that aims at maintaining the stability of distributed geospatial data processing systems during peak data arrival rates, with quality-of-service guarantees.","tags":["geospatial big data management","geospatial AQP","big data streams","unibo"],"title":"ApproxSSPS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview  SpatialSPE accepts a continuous query and QoS budgets (expressed as latency and accuracy targets) and employs our spatial-aware sampling method (that we dub as SAOS, which is an integral part of SpatialSPE) to select an appropriate sample, then it computes an approximate answer and serves it to the user incrementally, together with rigorous error bounds.

Avalanches of georeferenced mobility (human, vehicles, etc.,) and micro-blogging data (e.g., tweets) are being collected and processed daily.  However, mobility data alone is not enough to unleash the opportunities for insightful analytics that may assist in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. For example, answering complex queries such as follows: ‚Äúwhat are the Top-3 neighborhoods (districts, boroughs, etc.,) in Buenos Aires in Argentina in terms of vehicle mobility where the index of Particulate Matters (PM10) air-borne pollutant is greater than 40‚Äù. Similar queries are necessary for emergent health-aware smart city policies.  For example, they can provide insights to municipality administrators so that they foster the design of future city infrastructure plans that feature citizen health as a priority. For example, by restricting the number of vehicles accessing highly-polluted areas of the city during peak hours.   Also, such information can be used to build mobile interactive maps for daily dwellers so that to inform them which routes to avoid passing-through during specific hours of a day to avoid being subjected to high-levels of vehicle-caused air-borne pollutants (such as PM10).   However, answering such a query would require joining real-time mobility and environment (e.g., meteorological) data. Stock versions of the current Cloud-based open-source geospatial management systems do not include intrinsic solutions for such scenarios. MeteoMobil is a system for the combined analytics of integrated information representing mobility and environment conditions.

People seek relevant information, suggestions, and recommendations in an overloaded online world and through social ties regarding their daily activities, including places to visit and restaurants to try new food. The wide variety of choices that are available online causes information overloading, which thereby complicates the selection process.   Traditional recommender systems are mostly dependent on a conventional model that is based on user-item-rating interaction without considering contextual information. We claim that new generations of recommendation systems able to exploit context in an innovative and efficient way is important and may statistically yield more significant rating predictions. However, only few research works have focused on how to effectively and efficiently exploit context metadata in Deep Learning (DL)-based recommendations.  The main reason lies, perhaps most significantly, in the fact that most current DL algorithms are not intrinsically designed to incorporate contextual tags. In this project, we provide a significant contribution for filling this gap by designing a hybrid algorithm that retrofits and repurposes a pre-filtering contextual incorporation method and feeds the new dimension to a DL-based neural collaborative filtering method, thus preserving and recovering the benefits of both without their limitations.   Quantitative results show that our method outperforms the baselines by statistically significant margins.  publications: IEEE Access Journal\n","date":1623708615,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623708615,"objectID":"e1aac859b6985a165016c068a79a9951","permalink":"https://IsamAljawarneh.github.io/project/ca-ncf/","publishdate":"2021-06-14T22:10:15.3Z","relpermalink":"/project/ca-ncf/","section":"project","summary":"CA-NCF is a Pre-Filtering Approach for Incorporating Contextual Information Into Deep Learning Based Recommender Systems","tags":["recommendation systems","deep learning","unibo"],"title":"CA-NCF","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview  The problem of information overloading is prevalent in recommendations websites and social networks.

For this paradigm to be effective, these devices must exchange a huge amount of information and be coordinated in unpredictable, dynamic, and very complex scenarios. So far, cloud computing has centralized data storage and offered coordination of devices. However, as the number of deployed smart devices increases and the requirements of IoT solutions are more stringent, cloud computing hardly meets them. Fog computing has emerged as a middle layer between end-devices and cloud environments to support the requirements of IoT applications that cannot be met by the current edge-cloud model. A great effort has been devoted during the past few years to the development of this fog vision. Most of these solutions focused on improving specific characteristics, but not on supporting all the key requirements of an IoT solution. Thus, a deep investigation of these solutions to understand how they can be connected and coordinated to meet these necessities is essential. In this paper, we distinguish the most vital necessities that IoT solutions present to accomplish a right operation. Also, by analyzing the available solutions, we propose a novel global architectural model for fog computing meeting the recognized demands. We also provide a novel scientific taxonomy for breaking down the overviewed solutions. We conclude by analyzing the most essential recommendations in Fog computing for IoT, thereby distinguishing open issues and research frontiers that must be prioritized in order to have a totally developed fog computing environment, ready to meet the IoT solutions' prerequisites.","tags":["fog computing","unibo"],"title":"book chapter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh","Paolo Bellavista","Antonio Corradi","Luca Foschini","Rebecca Montanari","Javier Berrocal","Juan Manuel Murillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582228349,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582228349,"objectID":"f6c123e719a835d5bfe4eab0c8ba7477","permalink":"https://IsamAljawarneh.github.io/publication/ca-ncf/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T19:52:29.497Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ca-ncf/","section":"publication","summary":"summary","tags":["recommendation systems","unibo"],"title":"A pre-filtering approach for incorporating contextual information into deep learning based recommender systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh","Paolo Bellavista","Luca Foschini","Rebecca Montanari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575930571,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575930571,"objectID":"36757d0970e31bf0d83679d741666256","permalink":"https://IsamAljawarneh.github.io/publication/globecom2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T22:29:31.598Z","relpermalink":"/publication/globecom2019/","section":"publication","summary":"summary","tags":["geospatial AQP","geospatial big data management","big data streams","unibo"],"title":"Spatial-aware approximate big data stream processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview  SACHER Multidimensional Search Engine for Cultural Heritage service (SACHER MuSE CH) is an integral component of SACHER project.

The overarching characteristics of Docker and containerization have given them a momentum in their widespread adoption recently as alternatives for their counterparts. However, little research has been done for comparing the QoS of both technologies, thus leaving the domain without widely accepted performance metrics. Aiming at informing the decision of the best fit in a specific cloud deployment, we have designed performance metrics that compare the performance of both designs in an in-house cluster deployed by using OpenStack. We focus on well-established representatives as baselines, including KVM from the hypervisor-based side, LXD from the container-based side in addition to Docker. Our results show that containerization is not a predominant fit-all solution that can always replace hypervisors for all cluster deployment and application scenarios. It can instead be thought of as a complementary solution to use for specific application scenarios that are constrained with conditions that are solved by containerization merits.","tags":["edge big data management","unibo"],"title":"Qos and performance metrics for container-based virtualization in cloud environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Bertacchi","Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh","Fabrizio Ivan Apollonio","Gianna Bertacchi","Michele Cancilla","Luca Foschini","Costantino Grana","Giuseppe Martuscelli","Rebecca Montanari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543444171,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543444171,"objectID":"fae82e29c75c94eec82d864e2bff1e9c","permalink":"https://IsamAljawarneh.github.io/publication/sacher/","publishdate":"2018-11-28T22:29:31.598Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sacher/","section":"publication","summary":"The SACHER project provides a distributed, open source and federated cloud platform able to support the life-cycle management of various kinds of data concerning tangible Cultural Heritage.

The construction of Mobile Health Communities (MHC) supported by Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) is essential for mobile healthcare emergency scenarios. In a previous work, we have introduced the COLLEGA middleware, which integrates modules for supporting mobile health scenarios and the formation of MHCs through MCS. In this paper, we extend the COLLEGA middleware to address the need in real time scenarios to handle data arriving continuously in streams from MHC‚Äôs members. In particular, this paper describes the novel COLLEGA support for managing the real-time formation of MHCs.
